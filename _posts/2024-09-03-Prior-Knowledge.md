## 1. Introduction

**Why Bearing Fault Diagnosis is Essential**

Bearings are essential components of rotating machinery. Bearing failure can result in the complete shutdown of a system, thereby making the diagnosis of bearings critical for maintaining the safety and reliability of machinery systems. Numerous researches have developed various algorithms by adopting signal-processing techniques for diagnosis of mechanical systems, including bearings.
